I"<p>Need a staging API key and a separate live key? You can create up to 10 keys in your <a href="https://console.cord.com/">Developer Console</a> to separate logging, messages, etc. (Let <a href="mailto:partner-support@cord.com">us know</a> if you need more).</p>

<p>The keys are completely separate and can be configured separately, contain a separate set of user/org and message data, etc.</p>
