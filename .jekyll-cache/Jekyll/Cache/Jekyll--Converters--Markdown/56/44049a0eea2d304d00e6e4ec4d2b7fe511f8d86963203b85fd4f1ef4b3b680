I"Õ<p>We can create an @vendor alias (e.g, @Hubspot) that users can mention in the sidebar to send your success/support team messages from Cord. These messages can include annotations with screenshots and help you understand what your users need.</p>

<p>You can receive these messages in e-mail, in a Slack channel, or we can connect it to your Zendesk/Intercom ticketing system.</p>

<p><a href="mailto:partner-support@cord.com">Contact us</a> to set it up for you.</p>
