I"Œ<p>Want to know how your users are collaborating on your product? Great! There are two ways you can do that.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If youâ€™re using <a href="https://www.segment.io">Segment</a> for your analytics, you can give us a Segment key and we will create a Segment source for all of your usersâ€™ events connected to that key. You can then plug that into any Segment destination you wish. This is the <a href="">event schema</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If youâ€™re using GCP or AWS, we can dump all the events, daily, into a table in BigQuery or RDS. <a href="mailto:partner-support@cord.com">Contact us</a> to set it up.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
