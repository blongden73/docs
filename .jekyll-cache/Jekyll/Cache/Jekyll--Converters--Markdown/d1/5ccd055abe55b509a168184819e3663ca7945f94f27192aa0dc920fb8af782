I"a<p>Each integration partner has an <strong>application ID</strong> and an associated <strong>shared secret</strong>, which can be obtained through the developer dashboard and stored securely on the server, <strong>never exposed client side</strong>.</p>

<p>All API requests must include a valid <strong>access token</strong> as in the request headers: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Authorization: Bearer &lt;ACCESS_TOKEN&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>To obtain an access token, the application ID and shared secret are combined to generate a <strong>signed app token</strong>, which is then exchanged for the access token using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/v1/authorize</code> API. Access tokens have a limited lifespan (expiration is provided in the API response, normally 24 hours).</p>

<p>The signed app token is a JWT that must be generated server-side, with a short expiration (1 minute), containing the application ID in the payload <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">app_id</code> field, signed with the shared secret using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HS512</code> (HMAC using SHA-512 hash) algorithm.</p>
