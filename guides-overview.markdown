We love working together in products like Figma and Notion, and believe the rest of the internet should feel like that: connected, collaborative, multiplayer. Single-player is so 2020.
Leading companies like Typeform have trusted us to bring intuitive collaboration to 100,000s of their users. Top investors behind Notion, Slack, Figma, Canva, and Stripe also trust us to lead the way, and are investing in us to finally make this a reality.
